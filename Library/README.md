# ReactReduxStarter

This my boiler plate code for beginning a React with Redux Project

### Use git to get started
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/arendon094/ReactReduxStarter.git
> cd ReactReduxStarter
> npm install
> npm run start
```
